We used subversion (or svn for short) server running on windows as our version control server as it integrates very nicely with eclipse.

We found a guide for installation:

[Mere-Moments Guide to installing a Subversion server on Windows](http://excastle.com/blog/archive/2005/05/31/1048.aspx)

But it turned out all we really needed was the subversion 1-click install:

[svn 1-clicksetup](http://svn1clicksetup.tigris.org/)

Intergration with eclipse was easy too:

[Subclipse](http://subclipse.tigris.org/)

We also found a nice windows client for subversion:

[tortoisesvn](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)

Job done we're good to go.
