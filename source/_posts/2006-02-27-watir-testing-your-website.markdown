I am hoping to use this software to test my web developments, from what I have read it looks very promising.

_“WATIR stands for "Web Application Testing in Ruby". Watir
is a free, open-source functional testing tool for
automating browser-based tests of web applications. It is pronounced water.”_

**The install…**

Using the [Ruby One-Click installer for windows](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167) (version ruby182-15.exe), just run standard install accepting all defaults.

**NOTE: I tried the final version of Ruby 182-14 and had lots of install problems so use at least version 182-15!**

Using the [Watir One-Click installer for windows](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104) (version watir-1.4.1.exe), just run standard install accepting all defaults.

Now onto learning what can be done with this thing...
