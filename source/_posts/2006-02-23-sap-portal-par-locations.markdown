To find your PAR files once they are uploaded to the portal:

(Top Menu) Java Development -> (Left Sub Menu) Tools -> Portal Support Desk

(Main Page) Portal Runtime -> (Main Page) Browse Deployment

Now move to:

:ROOT/WEB-INF/deployment/pcd

You should now see a BIG list of files.

This is where your PAR files live!
