I was lucky enough to be at the Monaco F1 Grand Prix this year after a friend (John "Diddy" Donaldson) won a trip aboard a luxury yacht for the weekend. After nail biting coin toss I was invited along to literally the trip of a life time. So here are the photos, videos and links:

The only downside of the trip was the day after the race when depression sets in as you realise your not really a millionaire!
