# Trying out Octopress
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for the win!

Bloggin' from vim, yay.

Updated the theme to [darkstripes](https://github.com/amelandri/darkstripes)

Imported my old worpress posts using [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp)

## Code
``` ruby ruby, ruby, ruby
puts 'hello world!'
```

## Images
### I'm Old Gregg!
{% img /images/old-gregg.jpeg I'm old Gregg %}

## Quotes
### Block quote
{% blockquote Old Gregg, The Mighty Boosh %}
You ever drunk Baileys from a shoe?
{% endblockquote %}

### Pull quote
{% pullquote %}
Old Gregg's anatomy a species classification is a topic of debate. Some say
he's {" half man half fish "}, others say it's more of a 70/30 split.
{% endpullquote %}

## Video
{% youtube 5Enans8ABSM %}

That pretty much covers everything I want to do with this blog so I think
Octopress is a go, go, go!
