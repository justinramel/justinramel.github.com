<p>Last time we had a failing build with Jenkin’s showing a red ball to prove it.
The first place to look when we have a failing build is the console output. You
can get to the console output via the main menu on the left of your project
page.</p>

<h3 id="console-output">Console output</h3>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch07/console-output.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the screenshot shows we get all the output from our build process and there
is a lot of it! I’ve highlighted the actual problem which is the causing the
build to fail, our missing dll.</p>

<p>This is the error your team mates will see when they check out and try to build
your code.</p>

<h3 id="console-blindness">Console “blindness”</h3>

<p>When you first see the console output for your build it can be a little
overwhelming, there is a lot of information packed into the output. Sometimes
you look at all that information and you can’t see the wood for the trees, or
the errors in all that output. I have seen people look at this output and they
are blind to the errors.</p>

<p>Of course once you get used to looking at this output it becomes easier. To
help you get over this initially a simple search to find all the errors listed
on the page can really help. Simply search for the word “error” and your
browser will help you see again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch07/console-output-find.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You now have only a few places to concentrate your efforts in that sea of
information.</p>

<p>Next time we’ll look at the different ways to monitor our build and it’s
failures.</p>

<p>Lets break the build to see how Jenkins reacts. I’ll add a DLL to the project
then “forget” to add it to source control; unfortunately I see this problem a
lot when new developers join the team.</p>

<h3 id="i-see-red-projects">I see red projects</h3>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch06/red-ball.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see Jenkins now shows a red ball next to the Demo project. Also
notice the slightly cloudy weather icon indicating all is not well with our
project.</p>

<h3 id="hows-the-weather">How’s the weather?</h3>

<p>Jenkins uses a weather metaphor to show at a glance how a project is doing.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch06/weather-1.png" alt="" /></td>
      <td>No recent builds failed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch06/weather-2.png" alt="" /></td>
      <td>1 out of the last 5 builds failed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch06/weather-3.png" alt="" /></td>
      <td>2 out of the last 5 builds failed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch06/weather-4.png" alt="" /></td>
      <td>3 out of the last 5 builds failed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch06/weather-5.png" alt="" /></td>
      <td>4 out of the last 5 builds failed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch06/weather-6.png" alt="" /></td>
      <td>5 out of the last 5 builds failed (Yeah I know the icon is no different to 4, go figure.)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Obviously we want our projects to stay sunny and avoid the bad weather so next
time we’ll discuss how to diagnose and fix a broken build.</p>

<p>From the Project Demo page we created last time we can activate a Build at
will.</p>

<h3 id="build-now">Build Now</h3>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch05/build-now.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click the “Build Now” link.</p>

<p>This tells Jenkins to build the Job we have just defined.</p>

<h3 id="build-history">Build History</h3>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch05/build-history-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Build History will show the Job running. Once the build is complete you
should have your first successful build.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch05/build-history-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Clicking the Build History link (in this case 19-Feb-2012 00:10:39) will take
you to the build page for the Demo Job.</p>

<h3 id="console-output">Console Output</h3>

<p>This page allows us to access all the information relevant to the build we just
ran. The area we are interested in is the Console Output this shows all the
programs that ran during the build.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch05/console-output-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click the “Console Output” link.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch05/console-output-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the place to come whenever you are trying to debug a failing build.
Everything you need to fix the problem will usually be shown on this page.</p>

<p>As you can see this was a successful build and we can see that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jenkins created a workspace for the Job</li>
  <li>Ran a Subversion check out
    <ul>
      <li>Listed of all files updated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ran MSBuild
    <ul>
      <li>Shows all output from MSBuild</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shows Success message</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>In Jenkins the definition of a build process is called a Job. Jobs are created
using the main menu on the Jenkins home page. We’ll create a basic Job that
will checkout our source and build the solution.</p>

<p>From the main Jenkins menu, Click the ‘New Job’ link.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/04-00-new-job.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You now see the New Job configuration page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/04-01-new-job-page.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Set Job name to Demo.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘Build a free-style software project’ radio button.</li>
  <li>Click the ‘OK’ button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jenkins will now create the Job workspace on disk and redirect you to the job
configuration page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/04-02-job-config.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next we’re going to checkout our solution from source control and build it.  So
we first need to give Jenkins details of our source control server.</p>

<h2 id="source-control">Source Control</h2>

<p>For the purpose of this demo we’ll use
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>, mainly because this is the source
control management software I use day to day. Subversion is a very popular open
source choice for .NET.</p>

<p>Jenkins supports Subversion right out of the box but it also has support for
all the major source control management systems. For example here are few which
are popular for use with the .NET framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Team Foundation Server Plugin</strong> - <em>This plugin integrates Microsoft Team
Foundation Server source control to Jenkins.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Mercurial Plugin</strong> - <em>This plugin integrates the Mercurial version control
system with Jenkins.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Git Plugin</strong> - <em>This plugin allows use of Git as a build SCM. Git 1.3.3 or
newer is required.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Visual SourceSafe Plugin</strong> - <em>This plugin integrates Jenkins with Microsoft
Visual SourceSafe.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>I have created a Subversion repository on GoogleCode that we’ll use to demo the
build process from Jenkins. Lets setup our Job to grab the source code from
this repository. This is done in the Source Code Management section of the
configuration page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/04-03-source-code.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the Subversion radio button.</li>
  <li>Set the Repository URL to: <a href="https://jenkins-net-demo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk">https://jenkins-net-demo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="subversion-authentication">Subversion Authentication</h2>

<p>Unlike the demo repository used here, it’s more likely your source code
repository requires authentication (if it doesn’t, you may want to think about
securing it). If your repository does require authentication Jenkins will
display and error message and ask for you to supply login credentials.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/04-04-subversion-authentication.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click the “enter credential” link. You will now be shown the Subversion
Authentication page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/04-05-subversion-authentication-page.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Enter your authentication details and then click the “OK” button.</p>

<p>Subversion is now configured and we can move onto Build Triggers.</p>

<h2 id="build-triggers">Build Triggers</h2>

<p>We want to trigger a build every time our source code changes; we achieve this
by creating a “Build Trigger” which polls our source code repository. When a
change is detected a new build is triggered.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/build-trigger.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Under the Build Triggers section, tick the Poll SCM checkbox.</li>
  <li>Enter “5 * * * *” in the Schedule text area, this translates to check for changes every 5
minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see from the help (which is available by clicking the
<img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/question.png" alt="" /> icon) we can be extremely flexible
in how often we check the source code repository for changes. Checking every 5
minutes is my default as I tend make lots of small commits and I want to know
quickly if I’ve introduced a problem.</p>

<p>Finally we just need to tell Jenkins how to build the solution when changes are
detected. This is done via the “Add build step” button under the Build section.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/add-build-step.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click the “Add build step” button and select “Build a Visual Studio project or solution using MSBuild”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This adds a “Build a Visual Studio project or solution using MSBuild.” area under the Build section.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch04/build.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Set “MsBuild Version” to V3.5 (The version we setup previously)</li>
  <li>Set “MsBuild Build File” to the name of the demo solution: Jenkins-net-demo.sln</li>
  <li>Click the “Save” button and you’ll be redirected to the Demo project page</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations your first Jenkins Job is setup.</p>

<p>In my next post we’ll build it!</p>

</p>

<p>There are some important settings, that we need to configure before we get
started building our first project.</p>

<h2 id="manage">Manage</h2>

<p>On the main Jenkins menu, click the ‘Manage Jenkins’ link.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch03/03-00-manage.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You will now see the Manage Jenkins page. Click the ‘Configure System’ link to
get to the main configuration page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch03/03-00-manage-page.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="msbuild">MSBuild</h2>

<p>We need to setup MSBuild to carry out the compilation and build of your .NET
solutions. We can use any version of MSBuild you have installed on the Jenkins
machine. As Windows 7 comes with version 3.5 of the .NET Framework pre
installed I’ll demo that version here but obviously you can download, install
and use any version of the .NET Framework.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch03/03-02-msbuild.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click the ‘Add MSBuild’ button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jenkins-net/ch03/03-02-msbuild-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Set the name and path to MSBuild:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Name: v3.5</li>
  <li>Path to MSBuild: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.exe</li>
  <li>Click the ‘Save’ button</li>
</ol>

<p>In my next post we’ll actually get to setup our first job!</p>
